# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I use on Debian 10 with awesomewm.

## Install

1. Look through the repo to verify there are no conflicts
1. Clone the repo into your homedir
1. Reload any bash shell that you have open

## Pre-reqs

**Font:** Hack 10pt default font in terminal
**Shell:** Bash as your shell if you wish to use my .bashrc files
**Window Manager:** If you wish to use my awesomewm configs, you'll need awesomewm installed already

Some scripts and styles have been taken from various places around the net, so any work by them is greatly thanked.
