# dotfiles

Currently in the process of updating this repo to my latest dotfiles.

The previous version can still be found on the
['old' branch](https://github.com/brycecary/dotfiles/tree/old).

## Install

I use GNU Stow for linking my dotfiles and make for handling other actions
(like installing fonts).

## Neovim

Install:

```bash
make neovim # stow and install fonts
```
